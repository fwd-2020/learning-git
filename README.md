# Git: Version Control is Awesome

Reasons to love Git:

* It saves me the heartbreak of lost work
* It makes collaboration super fun
* It makes additional steps for doing what seem like simple things
* It lets you appear smarter than you really are

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. It's been great.
